     <h2>Using the Plotter</h2>
     <p>Click on the 'Plot' icon in the toolbar to open a plotter window
        which will show graphs of the variables found in the simulation
        results.</p>
    <p>If the simulation includes more than one analysis type then
        you can select the desired analysis by using the popup menu
        in the upper left corner of the plotter window. Typical
        analysis types are <i>DC</i>, <i>AC</i> and <i>transient</i>.</p>
     <p>When you move the pointer (mouse) around on the plotting area
        the values of the abscissa and of the ordinate at the visited
        point will be shown in the lower left corner. The abscissa
        value is designated 'X', and the ordinate value is 'Y'.</p>
     <p>You can copy the current plot to the system pasteboard by
        pressing <i>Command-C</i>. From there you can paste it into
        another application. You can also print the plot by pressing
        <i>Command-P</i></p>
     <p>The plotter can be customized to some extend. You will find global
        options (applying to all plotter windows) in the preferences panel.
        Additionally, clicking on the <b>Controls</b> button in the plot window
        will reveal (or hide) options which change the appearance of the plot.
        The rest of this page explains the control options.</p>
     <p><u>The <i>Graphs</i> Panel</u></p>
     <p><img src="plotter1.jpg"></p>
     <p><b>Hiding Variables</b>: By default, all simulation variables are plotted.
        Usually this results in clutter and it becomes hard to concentrate on
        the tracked variable. You can selectively hide variables by deselecting
        the buttons on the left of each variable you want to hide.</p>
     <p><b>Changing Graph Colors</b>: Clicking on the colored circle to the left
        of a variable's name opens a color dialog in which you can change the
        color of the graph. Tip: If you want to quickly change the colors of
        multiple variables then keep the color dialog open while selecting the
        next variable.</p>
     <p><b>Scaling</b>: You can set the scale factor of each variable
        after selecting it in the list and entering the desired scale factor in
        the text field at the bottom of the drawer. The default scale of the plot
        is set so that the variable with the greatest ordinate values fits nicely.
        Other variables may have values which are orders of magnitude smaller
        and which make them vanish. By scaling them up you make those graphs
        appear. The button '<i>Scale to Fit</i>' makes the graph fit into the
        plotting region, thereby providing you with a starting point for fine
        tuning the scale to suit your analysis. If the option '<i>scale around
        average</i>' is selected, graphs will not move away from the abscissa
        but be scaled around their average value, which is useful if, for example,
        you have a graph of a nonzero DC value with a small AC signal on it and
        you just want to make the AC part more visible.
     <p><b>Complex Values</b>: If the values of an analysis variable are complex
        numbers then the magnitude is displayed by default. You can choose an
        alternative representation by selecting one of the small radio buttons,
        which are located at the bottom of the drawer. The symbols <i>|z|</i>,
        <i>Re{z}</i>, and <i>Im{z}</i> stand for the magnitudes, the real parts,
        and the imaginary parts of the values, respectively. You can also view
        the Nyquist plot of the variable by pressing the button <b>Show Nyquist
        Plot</b>. A separate window will open for the Nyquist plot. The dot in
        the Nyquist plot marks the starting point of the trace.</p>
     <p><u>The <i>Plot</i> Panel</u></p>
     <p><img src="plotter2.jpg"></p>
     <p><b>Turning the grid on and off</b>: Use the checkbox '<i>Show Grid</i>'
        to turn the grid on or off.</p>
     <p><b>Turning labels on and off</b>: Currently the labels only show the
        limit values of the ordinate and the abscissa. Use the checkbox
        '<i>Show Labels</i>' to turn the labels on or off.</p>
     <p><b>Switching to logarithmic scale</b>: Use the checkboxes to set the
        scale of each axis to linear mode (when deselected) or logarithmic
        mode (when selected). Note that logarithmic scaling of an axis is not
        possible if, in the current viewing region, the axis includes zero or
        negative values. In that case no grid is drawn for that axis. Zoom out
        and select a subregion with only positive values for the selected axis
        to view it in logarithmic scale.</p>
     <p>If you prefer the labels to display the logarithm of the maximum and
        minimum values whenever the corresponding axis is set to logarithmic
        scale, then check the button designated <i>logarithmic labels for
        logarithmic scale</i>.</p>
     <p><u>The <i>Guides</i> Panel</u></p>
     <p><img src="plotter3.jpg"></p>
     <p><b>Guides</b> can be used to measure positions and interval lengths.
        There are two guides for marking positions along the abscissa,
        and two guides for marking positions along the ordinate. The guides
        are positioned by dragging the ends of the horizontal and vertical
        bars on the right and the top of the plotting area. Guides appear
        only when you click on a bar's end. The values for the current
        positions are displayed in the associated fields in the <i>Guides</i> panel.<br>
        The line width of the horizontal and vertical lines are the same as the
        grid's line width, which can be set in the preferences panel.</p>
     <p><b>Zoom-in</b> operations are performed by first adjusting the guides so that
        they frame the region that you want to zoom into and then clicking on the
        plus sign in the lower right corner of the plot window. Clicking on the
        minus sign returns you to the previous view or, if you there is no history,
        zooms out by a factor of 5/3. Zooming only works if you have a donation key.</p>
     <p>Note, that, if one or both of the axes are set to logarithmic scale and a
        zoom-out operation is performed, which makes one of the limit values become
        negative (or zero) then the graphs will jump to infinity and the zoom bar
        will vanish. In that case switch to linear scale and adjust the zoom
        region so that the values in the new range are all positive again.</p>
