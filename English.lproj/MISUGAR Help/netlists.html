    <h2>Editing Netlists, Running the Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        If you have already entered a schematic of your circuit then clicking
        on the 'Capture' button in the toolbar will automatically create a
        basic netlist. You can edit this netlist in the editor in order to add
        analysis commands or do whatever other modifications you want to do
        before running the simulation. If you want, you can enter the circuit
        specification by using the netlist editor only. The netlists should be
        in SPICE format since MI-SUGAR uses SPICE-compatible simulation engines.
        (If you are new to SPICE or Gnucap, you can view an online SPICE manual
        <a href="http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/Electronics2/userguide/sec1.html">here</a>
        or download the printable manuals of both Gnucap and SPICE from the
        <a href="http://www.macinit.com/">MacInit website</a>.)
        To edit an existing netlist file you can either open the file
        chooser (<i>File</i>-><i>Open</i>) and browse your computer or drag the
        file onto an open window or the dock icon.

        To improve readability the lines are colored according to the following schema:<br><br>
        <center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10">
          <tr><td><b>analysis commands</b></td><td><font color="#660000"><b>dark red</b></font></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>PRINT statements</b></td><td><font color="#ce7224"><b>orange</b></font></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>model definitions</b></td><td><font color="#806600"><b>dark yellow</b></font></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>title, end, comments</b></td><td><font color="#989898"><b>grey</b></font></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>subcircuit header</b></td><td><font color="#0000ff"><b>blue</b></font></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>everything else</b></td><td><font color="#000066"><b>dark blue</b></font></td></tr>
        </table></center>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have finished editing the netlist you can run the simulation by clicking the
        <b>Analyze</b> button in the window's toolbar. If the simulation takes too long
        you can abort the process by pressing the button once again. The default circuit
        simulator is SPICE. You can change it to Gnucap or to a custom SPICE-compatible
        simulator in the <b>Simulator</b> sub-panel of the preferences panel. Gnucap and
        SPICE commands are very similar but Gnucap does not yet support all SPICE
        commands and has an additional command set of its own. So always keep in mind
        that a Gnucap file does not necessarily work with SPICE, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data, resulting from the analysis, will appear in the output text area.
        Any warnings or errors that occur during the simulation will also be displayed
        there. You will only see the data for the analysis variables which you have explicitly
        specified with the PRINT command. Please refer to the user manuals of SPICE and Gnucap
        to learn more about the PRINT command.

        Note: MI-SUGAR only loads files with the extensions <b>cir</b>, <b>ckt</b> or <b>sugar</b>.
        Files with other extensions will be rejected.
