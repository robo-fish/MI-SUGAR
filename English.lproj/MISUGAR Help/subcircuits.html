             With <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> you can turn circuits or parts of circuits into
             reusable schematic elements. Hence, you can create higher-level
             elements by using the basic circuit elements (resistor, capacitor,
             etc.) and even other high-level elements. This feature is basically
             an expansion of SPICE subcircuits into the schematic world. That's
             why in MI-SUGAR the high-level elements are called subcircuit elements.
           </p>
           <p><a name="library"></a><u><b>The Subcircuit Library</b></u></p>
           <p>
             <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> reads subcircuits from a special folder.
             You can set the
             location of that folder in the <i>Preferences</i> window.
             MI-SUGAR helps you organize your subcircuit library by providing
             a quick link to the subcircuit folder (in the <i>Circuit</i> menu)
             and a refresh button below the subcircuit list in the elements panel.
             Note that the subcircuit list mirrors the folder structure of your
             local subcircuit library.
           </p>
           <p>
             <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> supports subcircuit namespaces. You can use
             namespaces
             to categorize your subcircuits. A name clash occurs only if both
             the namespace and the name of two subcircuits are identical.
             Namespaces are assigned during subcircuit creation and can be any
             text string you like. A good namespace
             should uniquely identify the creator internationally. Therefore,
             reverse domain name notation or a similar scheme is recommended.
             For example, I use namespaces which start with "macinit" and
             continue with logical group names.
		   </p>
           <p>
             You can also specify a revision for the subcircuit. This can be any
             string but usually is a version number or date. The revision is not
             used by <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr>, it's just extra information for the
             users of the subcircuit.

       <p>
         Preparation:
         <ul>
           <li>Open or create the circuit which you want to
               turn into a subcircuit.</li>
           <li>If the original subcircuit is a pure netlist then
               drop as many node elements on the schematic area
               as there will be external ports.</li>
           <li>Label the node elements (in the schematic), which
               are going to be used as external ports. Short and
               descriptive names are recommended. Use standard
               abbreviations, like GND for ground and VCC for supply
               voltage.</li>
         </ul>
	   </p>
       <p>
         Now you can create the subcircuit by following these steps:
         <ol>
           <li>Select <i>Make Subcircuit...</i> from the <i>Circuit</i> menu.</li>
           <li>Set the name and, optionally, the namespace and revision of the subcircuit.</li>
           <li>If you are not using a custom shape choose the number of external ports.</li>
           <li>If you are using a custom shape load the shape definition file.</li>
           <li>Assign nodes to the external ports by selecting a node name for
              each external port in the assignment table. Blank means "not connected".</li>
           <li>Finally, click on the <i>Create!</i> button. The subcircuit list in
               the elements panel refreshes automatically.</li>
         </ol>
       </p>
	   <p>
         Tip: You can also create new subcircuits from existing ones.
       </p>
       <p><a name="customshape"></a><u><b>Custom Shapes</b></u></p>
       <p>
         By default <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> uses DIP (dual in-line package) shapes
         for all subcircuits. (If you don't know already, pins of a DIP are numbered
         in counter-clockwise ascending order, where pin number 1 is marked by
         a dot. The pins correspond to the external ports of the subcircuit.)
         User-defined, custom shapes are possible. You specify a custom shape by
         creating an XML file and loading it in the subcircuit creator.

         The file format is defined in the following file: <a href="http://www.macinit.com/schemas/sesdl.xml">
         http://www.macinit.com/schemas/sesdl.xml</a>. The proposed
         Subcircuit Element Shape Definition Language (SESDL) let's you specify
         the shape in a manner similar to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG<a>.
         MI-SUGAR 0.5.7 does not fully support the SESDL yet. Only paths with <b>move</b>,
         <b>lineto</b>, <b>arc</b> and <b>curve</b> commands are recognized.

         When <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> captures a circuit it first compiles a set of
         all the subcircuits and device models that the circuit depends on.
         Finally the device model definitions are pulled from the device model
         library and the subcircuit netlists are copied from the netlist
         section of each type of subcircuit. Since <nobr>MI-SUGAR</nobr> does
         not re-capture
         the subcircuits to get the netlist your netlist modifications
         will be preserved. This means that you can create subcircuits
         that have no schematic representation (e.g., vacuum tubes, which
         are expressed as a set of voltage/current equations). To do so you
         have to put as many node elements into the schematic as there
         will be external ports of the subcircuit. Then you create the
         subcircuit in the usual manner. At that stage you need not worry
         about the netlist because you're going to modify it after the
         subcircuit has been created and added to your library. Remember to
         use the names of the nodes in the schematic to connect your
         subcircuit to the outside.
       </p>
       <p><a name="using"></a><u><b>Using Subcircuits</b></u></p>
       <p>
         To add a subcircuit to the current circuit first select the
         desired subcircuit from the table n the elements panel by
         clicking on it. The shape of the subcircuit appears on top.
         Drag the shape into the schematic work area.
       </p>
       <p>
         When a circuit is captured the whole subcircuit hierarchy on
         which the circuit depends will be dumped to the netlist editor.
         The implication of this is that another user who opens the file
         can run the circuit analysis although he/she may not have copies
         of the original subcircuit files. However the other user can't
         use the schematic and must not capture the schematic, otherwise
         the netlist will become invalid.
       </p>
       <p><a name="modifying"></a><u><b>Modifying Subcircuits</b></u></p>
       <p>
         Double-click on the name of the subcircuit in the tree view to
         open its <i>definition</i>, that is, the document which contains the
         schematic (and netlist) that defines the subcircuit. Alternatively
         you can double-click on the subcircuit file in the Finder to open
         it. Make the changes to the schematic (or the netlist) and save it.
