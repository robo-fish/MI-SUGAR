     <h2>Exporting the Results</h2>
     <p>
       Sometimes it is desirable to perform some sort of postprocessing
       on the analysis results. MI-SUGAR has no such capabilities (yet)
       but it can export the analysis results into files that can be read
       by Mathematica&reg;, Matlab&reg; and other applications.
       To export the analysis results into one of the following formats
       use the export commands in the <i>Circuit</i> menu.
       For each analysis type that was run one file will be created.
     </p>
     <p>
       <b>File formats:</b>
       <ol>
         <li>
           <b>MathML</b>: The Mathematical Markup Language is an XML-based format
           supported by Mathematica. A description of the MathML can
           be found at the web site of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">
           World Wide Web Consortium</a>.<br>
           <p>
             The names of the analysis variables will be modified - to avoid
             syntax errors - according to the following rules:
             Opening parantheses and pound characters (#) are replaced with
             dollar characters ($) and closing parantheses are discarded.
             Example: <i>V(4)</i> becomes <i>V$4</i>, and <i>vgs#branch</i>
             becomes <i>vgs$branch</i>.
             The variable types will be vectors for variables without sweep
             steppings, and matrices for variables with sweep stepping, where
             each row of the matrix contains the values corresponding to one
             step of the sweep variable.
           </p>
           <p>
             To import a MathML file into Mathematica type
             <pre>
             Import["&lt;filename&gt;", "MathML"]
             </pre>
             followed by
             <pre>
             ToExpression[%]
             </pre>
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Matlab</b>: These files contain Matlab commands. The analysis results
           are stored in the form of Matlab vectors and matrices.<br>
           <p>
             Exporting to Matlab is similar to exporting to MathML. Again, the data is put
             into vectors and matrices, depending on the existence of a sweep variable.
             However, the variable renaming scheme is a bit different for Matlab:
             Pound signs (#) and opening parentheses are converted to
             underscores (_) instead of dollars ($). The data is exported to "<b>.m</b>"
             files which can be imported by simply entering the name of the file
             from within Matlab.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Tabular Text</b>: In this format data is structured in columns, one for
           each output variable. The number of rows is the number of values
           in the variables. Each column has the same number of rows.
           The file starts with a line which lists the names of the variables
           and there is an empty line before each sweep set.<br>
         </li>
       </ol>
     </p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><b>Example session with Mathematica:</b></p>
     <p>
       The analysis results for the circuit "RC Oscillator.cir"
       (available from the Sample Circuits directory in the distribution package
       or on the Web site) is exported in MathML format to the file 'osci.mml'.
       In Mathematica we import it and turn the data for each variable into lists.
       We can now easily plot the data and its Fourier transform.

       Note: The exporting features requires a valid license key. The exported
       files were verified with Matlab 6.5 (Release 13) and Mathematica 4.2 on
       Mac OS X.
