       In the Preferences panel you can adjust various settings to customize
       the behavior of MI-SUGAR. The panel is divided into sections, which are
       shortly described here.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="general"></a><b>General Preferences</b><br>
       In the <i>Function</i> section:<br>
       <b>1.</b> Set the file format which will be used to save the circuits.
       There are three options: To always save as a <i>.sugar</i> file
       (saves everything), to save as a <i>.cir</i> file (only netlist)
       if the schematic is empty, and to save as a <i>.cir</i> file only.
       If you create a netlist and save it as a <i>.cir</i> file you won't
       be able to add a schematic to it later on. You will have to open an
       empty document, copy the netlist and save it in the <i>.sugar</i>
       format.<br>
       <br>
       <b>2.</b> You can set the file conversion policy for
       netlist files which may contain Windows-style lone CR (carriage
       return) characters that would cause errors when using SPICE. MI-SUGAR
       filters these characters automatically for the current session.
       To also modify the file content you either have to edit and save
       or select an appropriate file conversion policy.
       There are three conversion policies: <i>Ask</i> for being asked about how
       to proceed every time such a file is encountered, <i>Never</i> for no
       automatic conversion of the file content, and <i>Always</i> for always
       automatically converting the file contents.<br>
       <br>
       <b>3.</b> Set the folder which will be scanned for subcircuits (subfolders
         included). The new folder will be used immediately.
     </p>
     <p>
       In the <i>Appearance</i> section you can choose the window layout you would
       like to use. <i>Vertical</i> stacks all views (schematic area, netlist
       editor, output area) on top each other. <i>Horizontal</i> places the
       netlist editor and output area to the right of the schematic area.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="startup"></a><b>Startup Preferences</b><br>
       Here you can set actions that will be executed during every startup
       of MI-SUGAR. If you usually create new netlists after
       starting MI-SUGAR you should select the option to open
       an empty circuit window. If you mostly edit previously
       created files then leave that option unselected.<br>
       MI-SUGAR can check if a newer version is available during startup and
       notify you when it finds a newer version. You can disable this
       automatic checking if you want to.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="schematic"></a><b>Schematic Preferences</b><br>
       In the <i>Function</i> section you can enable/disable
       placement guides (the green alignment lines) and the automatic
       insertion of node elements into the connection line which they
       were dropped on. In the <i>Appearance</i> section you can set the
       background color of the schematic area.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="simulator"></a><b>Simulator Preferences</b><br>
       Here you can set the circuit simulator which will be used to analyze
       the circuit. You may choose between the two built-in simulators SPICE
       and Gnucap or select 'custom simulator' and enter the path to an
       external simulator. The custom simulator should recognize the same
       command options as SPICE.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="plotter"></a><b>Plotter Preferences</b><br>
       There are two categories: Appearance preferences and functional
       preferences. You can set the line widths of the graphs and the
       grid and the background color and grid color in the appearance
       category. Behavioral preferences can be set in the function
       category. 'Remember plot settings' makes the plotter remember
       all settings in the 'Plot' section of the control panel. The
       current settings will then be automatically applied to all new
       plotter windows. 'Show guides tab when guides are dragged' makes
       the plotter's control panel automatically slide open (if it was
       closed) and switch to the 'Guides' section whenever any of the
       four guides is dragged. The previous view is restored when the
       dragged guide is released. 'Close previous plot windows' causes
       all previous plot windows, that belong to the same circuit, to be
       closed when a new plot window is opened.
     </p>
     <p>
       <a name="font"></a><b>Font Preferences</b><br>
       Here you can set the fonts used in the netlist editor and in the
       simulator output area in the circuit window.
