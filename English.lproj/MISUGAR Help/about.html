       <p>
       MI-SUGAR (pronounced "<i>my sugar</i>") is a graphical interface for
       the free command-line circuit simulators SPICE and Gnucap, which
       come bundled with MI-SUGAR. With MI-SUGAR you can create electrical
       circuits, run simulations and plot the results. Although circuits can
       be easily created with the schematic tool you need to have a basic
       knowledge of SPICE to simulate the circuit.
       </p>
       <p>
       Circuits can be created either by using the schematic tool or by directly
       entering the circuit description in the <i>netlist</i> editor. Netlists 
       are textual descriptions of electrical circuits. They list circuit
       elements and node numbers (or names) assigned to the connection points
       of the elements, thus creating a circuit topology. MI-SUGAR can convert
       schematics to netlist. Analysis commands and other control options,
       however, have to be added manually to the generated netlist.
       The netlist is then fed to the circuit simulator. The simulation results
       can be viewed in the graph plotter. 
       </p>
       <p>
       This version of MI-SUGAR requires Mac OS X version 10.4 or newer.
