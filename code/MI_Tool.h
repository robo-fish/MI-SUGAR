 MI_Tool subclass objects are used to
 process user input on a schematic in a special ways.
 The main control object maintains a palette of tool objects
 but only one of them is active at a time. The active tool
 is set by the user. When a schematic canvas has to process
 user input it delegates input events to the current selected
 tool.
