/*
 Tool for selecting and dragging elements and making connections.
 
 When the mouse hovers on top of a connection point the point is
 highlighted (red dot). By clicking on the highlighted dot and
 dragging the mouse the user creates a connection lines which
 is connected to the initial connection point on one end and
 loose on the other. The loose end follows the mouse position.
 The user can abort by releasing the mouse button, which will
 automatically remove the connection line. An unconnected
 connection point is highlighted when the user drags the loose
 end of the connection line over it. A connection is made when
 the mouse button is released over an unconnected connection point.
 
 When the user presses the mouse button over a connection point
 and holds for more than 1 second then the mode switches from
 connection line dragging to element dragging, where the element to
 which the connection point belongs to is added to the selection.
