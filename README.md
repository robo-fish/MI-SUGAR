MI-SUGAR is a simple electronic circuit sketching and analysis app for macOS. It dates back to early 2003, when there were no native Mac applications for circuit design. The circuit simulator is a modified version of SPICE 3F5, which was made to build and run on Darwin, Apple's variant of BSD Unix.
