# MI-SUGAR

This is a simple macOS app for sketching electronic circuits and running simulations. It dates back to early 2003, when there were no native Mac applications for circuit design. The simulator is a modified version of SPICE 3F5, which was made to build and run on Darwin, Apple's variant of BSD Unix.
