/*

 Provides a Dual In-line Package (DIP) shape for use with subcircuits.
 In its initial orientation the pins of the DIP are at the bottom and the top
 where pin number 1 is nearer to the left. The name of the subcircuit type is
 drawn into its body. The length of the shape depends on the number of pins.
 The width is a constant 36.0 units (including pins).
 The pins are thin lines of length 5.0.
 The distance between two neighboring pins is 10.0 and the distance between
 the last pin in a line and the nearest edge is half of that.
 Important: Pin numbering in counter-clockwise.
